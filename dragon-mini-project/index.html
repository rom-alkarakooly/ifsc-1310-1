    <h2>Welcome to SpaceX</h2>
    <p>Founded in 2002 by Elon Musk, SpaceX is dedicated to advancing space technology with the ultimate vision of enabling life beyond Earth. We design, manufacture, and launch advanced rockets and spacecraft, continuously pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in space exploration.</p>
    <p>Our revolutionary spacecraft, <strong>Dragon</strong>, has reshaped space missions for cargo and crew, with its historic milestone in 2012 as the first commercial spacecraft to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and safely return to Earth. Designed to carry both cargo and crew, Dragon represents a significant step toward expanding human access to space.</p>

    <h2>Dragon Spacecraft Overview</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Dragon</strong> spacecraft is a versatile, free-flying vehicle capable of transporting a range of cargo and, soon, crew members to and from orbiting destinations like the International Space Station (ISS). With unique configurations for different mission needs, Dragon’s capabilities are unmatched in the commercial space sector.</p>
    <h3>Configurations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cargo:</strong> Designed for resupply missions, Dragon transports pressurized and unpressurized cargo to the ISS, including essential materials like biological samples in freezer-equipped cargo racks.</li>
      <li><strong>Crew:</strong> With NASA’s partnership, Dragon is being upgraded to safely carry astronauts. It will feature life-support systems, seating for up to seven passengers, and an emergency launch escape system.</li>
      <li><strong>Dragon Lab:</strong> An independent microgravity laboratory for research, Dragon Lab supports experiments and testing in space environments without docking to the ISS.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Journey</h2>
    <p>Since Dragon’s development in 2004, SpaceX has achieved groundbreaking milestones in spaceflight, such as being the first private company to recover a spacecraft from orbit in 2010 and deliver cargo to the ISS in 2012. Through ongoing contracts with NASA, SpaceX continues to innovate in space transportation.</p>
