    <h2>Dragon Development Timeline</h2>
    <p>The Dragon spacecraft was conceived as a versatile, reusable vehicle capable of carrying both cargo and crew to low Earth orbit and beyond. It has undergone several key phases of development and testing to reach its current capabilities:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Phase 1 - Cargo:</strong> Dragon’s initial design focused on cargo missions under NASA’s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, resulting in successful ISS resupply missions.</li>
      <li><strong>Phase 2 - Crew Dragon:</strong> In collaboration with NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, Dragon was adapted to transport astronauts, featuring advanced safety systems like the emergency launch escape system and environmental controls for crew comfort.</li>
      <li><strong>Phase 3 - Dragon Lab:</strong> Designed for standalone missions, Dragon Lab provides a microgravity research platform for a variety of scientific and technological experiments.</li>
