                <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2>
                <p>Web accessibility is about making websites easy for everyone to use, 
                    even people with disabilities. This means thinking about things like 
                    if someone can't see well, hear, or has trouble using their hands. 
                    Making websites accessible is important because it helps everyone get
                    the same information and use the web equally. 
                    Plus, it makes websites better for everyone since they become easier to use. 
                    By following rules like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), 
                    we help create a fairer internet for all people.</p>

                <h2>Throughts on Progressive Enchancement</h2> 
                <p>Progressive enhancement is a simple way to make websites work well for everyone, no matter what device or browser 
                    theyâ€™re using. It starts with the basics: making sure the main content of a site is clear and usable for everyone. 
                    Think of it as building a Peanut M&M: the "peanut" is the content that all users can access. Once that core is solid, 
                    you add a "chocolate layer" of design (CSS) to make it look nice, and then a "hard candy shell" of interactivity 
                    (JavaScript) for users with modern devices and browsers. This method is better than the old way, called graceful degradation, which focused on creating fancy 
                    features for advanced browsers and then cutting back for older ones. Progressive enhancement does the opposite: 
                    it starts with the essentials and builds up, so no one is left out. This approach is
                    important because it makes websites more accessible, easier to maintain, and better for all users, 
                    including those with older technology or slower connections.
