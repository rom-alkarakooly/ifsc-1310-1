                <h2>Thoughts on Web Accessibility</h2> <!--Heading for section -->
                <p>Web accessibility is about making websites easy for everyone to use, 
                    even people with disabilities. This means thinking about things like 
                    if someone can't see well, hear, or has trouble using their hands. 
                    Making websites accessible is important because it helps everyone get
                    the same information and use the web equally. 
                    Plus, it makes websites better for everyone since they become easier to use. 
                    By following rules like the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), 
                    we help create a fairer internet for all people.</p>
